    - Take exp out of towers by hitting them with your scepter
    - No tower friendly fire? (On second thought, maybe we keep it, it's kind of funny)

## TODO NO MORE
### 10/07/24
+ Added temple tileset
+ Added Cypress trees and functionality for spawning 'scenery' entities
+ Added building assembler, which uses the tile sets to assemble buildings in a rectangular shape

### 10/06/24
+ Added marble walls, built with 2 marble
+ Enemies can destroy blocks in block piles (full ingredients left when a tower is destroyed), so it is very dangerous to leave towers undefended

---

+ Your damage to turn a tower back into ingredients is now separate from enemy damage to towers, and all towers take only 3 hits from the player to destroy, regardless of their health
+ Towers now start at 0 hp and reach their max hp when they are fully built
+ Enemies can now attack towers that are still building
+ Fixed bug where the shopkeeper was giving you more coins than the sell price for blocks
+ Fixed crash that occurred if you tried to change levels while music was fading in or out (oops)
+ Added support for projectiles to travel in arcs, deal area damage, and have pierce
+ Projectiles are now (mostly) data based and should be (mostly) easy to make many different kinds

---

+ Added trebuchet tower, which absolutely wrecks because there are no tanky enemies yet
+ There are now 'large' and 'small' towers, all towers can be moved but large towers slow you down more and only small towers can fire while being moved

### 10/05/24
+ Spent time with fam ðŸ‘Œ
+ Towers now slowly gain exp when you stand next to them
+ Towers prioritize targets with bread based on distance from point to protect, and they prioritize them over all other targets

### 10/04/24
+ Music
    + Level
    + Boss
    + Victory

+ Smooth fades for background tracks

+ Random callouts can be set on a per character basis
+ Drops can be set on a per character basis

+ Each faction can have its own base, spawner, pathing, and units (including your own)
+ You can win still while having allied units alive (previously victory only allowed when all units were dead)

+ Bread pile that must be defended
+ Enemies that reach the bread pile take 1 bread and attempt to leave the map with it
+ Lose when all bread has left the map
+ Enemies carrying bread drop the bread as a pickup (like coins) when they die
+ Dropped bread can only be picked up by the player, but will despawn after 15 seconds if not picked up (thus counting as having lost the bread)
+ Non-player factions can have a bread pile, and are destroyed when their bread pile is empty (even if it has not all left the map yet)

+ Pickups now despawn after 20 seconds so that bread can't be left on the ground to make the player invincible

+ Dialogue readers in world space and GUI, but no dialogue system to make use of them (that's next)

---

+ Towers are now data based and can level up from getting kills
+ Units now attack towers/walls that they walk into, and different towers have different max hp and hp regen rates

+ Enemies taking bread from the pile but not being able to pick up fallen bread was making the game far too easy unfortunately... Now they eat a certain amount of bread and die (?) once they are finished eating.

---

+ Coins can now be used at the shop to buy blocks used for making towers
+ Blocks can also be sold at the shop
+ Shop sells at markup and buys at markdown, amount can change per shop
+ Shop has a shopkeeper that announces prices (but he is invisible right now because I haven't done the art)

### 10/03/24
+ Peasant
    + Random peasant callouts

+ Enemies drop resource for getting blocks (coins)

+ Right click on towers multiple times to break them down into pieces again

+ Interact button to build a tower from a blockpile, instead of it happening automatically
+ Sprite that shows up when a blockpile is a valid recipe and it is highlighted

+ Last wave gets special boss music
+ Main Menu
+ Mission Select menu
+ After killing all enemies in last wave, victory state
+ Enemies come in premade waves (resource)
